# I managed to install 2 separate versions of stable-diffusion. This bash script will help sort the actions
# 
# here's the plan:
# 1. I build the script to run the PS3 selection [X] 
##	a. I decided to do away with the PS3 because in my situation, I don't want to learn how to use the function but rather do it the long way
##	b. While experience would say that learning to use the tools - the advanced ones - is really how to do it, I'd rather learn WHY I use PS3 - in other words, "I'm sick of doing it the long way"
# 2. the PS3 right now just echoes what you are doing
# 3. the PS3 eventually should be routing us to the script/action we want to do
# 4. I'm gon keep researching like BASH functions and stuff so I can route command where it needs to go
# 5. Also a goal is to hit the script with all the arguments for txt2img and img2img and once the user has selected the action, the input params are then passed to the script called
# 6. Also ALSO a goal is if there are NO parameters passed, and the user DOESN'T dream or exit, that there will be prompts for basic input parameters to the script.
